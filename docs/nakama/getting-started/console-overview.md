# Nakama Console

The Nakama console is a powerful and flexible UI for your Nakama server instance. It enables easy access to player and server data, allowing both technical and non-technical users to quickly perform any needed service tasks.

By default, Nakama console is available on port `7351`, for example [127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351) when running Nakama locally. The console provides the following pages and features:

* [Status](#status)
* [User Management](#user-management)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Runtime Modules](#runtime-modules)
* [Accounts](#accounts)
* [Storage](#storage)
* [Leaderboards](#leaderboards)
* [Matches](#matches)
* [API Explorer](#api-explorer)

In addition to the above, there are also convenient links to the Heroic Labs official [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/), [forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com/), and [blog](https://heroiclabs.com/blog/).

## Status

![Console Status Page](images/console/console-status.png)

The Status page provides a realtime view of your Nakama server, with usage details for each node and a general view into bandwidth and latency, including:

* Latency: The time spent executing Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functions, in milliseconds (ms).
* Rate: The number of RPCs per second.
* Input: Inbound traffic in kilobytes per second (kb/s).
* Output: Outbound traffic in kilobytes per second (kb/s).

## User management

![Console User Management Page](images/console/console-user-management.png)

!!! note "Note"
    The User Management page is only available to users with the Administrator role.

The User Management page allows you to add new console users, or delete any existing users. When creating new users there are four available roles, enabling you to set up your support team with access to only the UI features they need.

## Configuration

![Console Configuration Page](images/console/console-user-management.png)

The Configuration page enables you to view and export all [configuration](configuration.md) details of your Nakama server.

Additionally, you can [import storage data](#importing-storage-data) or delete all data.

### Importing storage data

Drag-and-drop or browse for and select your desired file to import. A sample JSON file is provided below:
